This is a simple pokemon search app made using the PokeAPI API. I made this back then when I was learning JavaScript. Was really excited to work with an API and being able to use fetch was like a mini dream come true.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- PokeAPI

## Getting Started

Make sure you have the ```live server``` extension installed in VS Code. Then fork and clone the repo. Once cloned, just fire up the live server and enjoy.
